# SCLAM
SNOW17-CREST-Integrated Landslide Model

The SCLAM only requires precipitation and temperaturea sa meteorological forcings.
Maximum, minimum and mean temperatura are applied to calculate snow melting process by SNOW17, and to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET) to proceess subsurface hydorlogical components an discharge estimation by CREST.
User can choose the best way to estimate PET. This template provide PET examples estimated by Hargreaves-Samani method at daily time step, a simple way that only requires minimum and maximum temperature. Optimal for scarce data region.
